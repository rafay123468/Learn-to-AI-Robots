   <h1> Summary on AI Robots</h1>
<P>AI Robots are machines that combine Artificial Intelligence (AI) with robotics. Unlike traditional robots, AI robots can think, learn, and make decisions instead of just following pre-programmed 
command.</P>
<h2>Key Features of AI Robots</h2>
<b>Perception → They use sensors, cameras, and microphones to understand their surroundings.</b> 
<br>
<b>Decision-Making → AI algorithms help them analyze data and choose the best action.</b>
<br>
<b>Learning Ability → With Machine Learning, they improve performance over time.</b>
<br>
<b>Autonomy → They can perform tasks with little or no human intervention.</b>
<br>
<h4>Types of AI Robots</h4>
1.<i>Industrial Robots Used in factories for assembling, packaging, welding, etc.</i> 
<br>
2. <i>Service Robots Help in hospitals, hotels, and customer service.</i>
<br>
3. <i>Humanoid Robots Designed to look and act like humans (e.g., Sophia).</i>
<br>
4. <i>Autonomous Robots Self-driving cars, delivery drones.</i>
<br>
5. <i>Military & Space Robots Used for defense, exploration, and risky missions.</i>
